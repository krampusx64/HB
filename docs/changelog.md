- Add claim confidence classification (real/example/unclear) to docs audit, with code-block awareness and placeholder name detection

### Changed
- Rewrite docs audit action strings with source-of-truth framing (code is authoritative, docs must be updated to match)

## [0.46.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Dedicated `status` command for focused, actionable component overview with filtering flags (`--uncommitted`, `--needs-bump`, `--ready`, `--docs-only`, `--all`) (#121, #119)

- **App config**: Extend `AppConfig` with `installedModules: HashMap<String, InstalledModuleConfig>`; each extension stores `settings: HashMap<String, Value>` and optional `sourceUrl` (stored in the extension manifest).
- **Extension scoping**: Add `ExtensionScope::{effective_settings, validate_project_compatibility, resolve_component_scope}` to merge settings across app/project/component and validate `ExtensionManifest.requires` (for example: `components`).
- **Extension execution**: Tighten `homeboy extension run` to require an installed/configured entry and resolve project/component context when CLI templates reference project variables.
- **Command context**: Refactor SSH/base-path resolution to shared context helpers (used by `db`/`deploy`) for more consistent configuration errors.

- **Config**: Support `changelogTargets` + `changelogNextSectionLabel`/`changelogNextSectionAliases` at component/project/app levels.
- **Version**: Write JSON version bumps via the `version` key (pretty-printed) when using the default JSON version pattern.

## 0.1.9

### Improvements

- **Docs**: Updated embedded docs to reflect new/removed commands.

## 0.1.8

### Improvements
- **Versioning**: `versionTargets` are now first-class for component version management (supports multiple files and multiple matches per file, with strict validation).

## 0.1.7

### Improvements
- **Component configuration**: Support `versionTargets` (multiple version targets) and optional `buildCommand` in component config.
- **Version bumping**: `homeboy version bump` validates that all matches in each target are the same version before replacing.
- **Deploy JSON output**: Deploy results include `artifactPath`, `remotePath`, `buildCommand`, `buildExitCode`, and an upload exit code for clearer automation.
- **Docs refresh**: Updated command docs + JSON output contract; removed outdated command/contract doc.

## 0.1.6

### New Features
- **Embedded docs**: Embed `homeboy/docs/**/*.md` into the CLI binary at build time, so `homeboy docs` works in Homebrew/releases.
